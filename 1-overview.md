I would like to build an app that would prevent people from scamming, advertising, and pranking phone calls. The motivation behind this idea is that I usually pick up a phone call, and the person on the other end hangs up immediately. Another reason is that scams and advertising phone calls were common in my home country. Therefore, I hope I can build an app that can help prevent people from picking up these types of phone calls.

My aim is to build an application that will allow users to enter a phone number, and the application will show the chances of this phone call being an inappropriate call to pick up, the purpose of the call, and the location of where the call is being made. Users can also report a phone number. The more frequently a phone number is reported, the higher the risk. Depending on the number of times the phone numbers have been reported, they will be assigned to different levels of risk. The application would also detect if there is an incoming call to the user's phone and send a notification to ask if the user want to block or report the phone number.
