In the given time, I was able to implement most of the features that I wanted. Before building this application, I was still unfamiliar with using Android Studio and the process of completing the application has definitely helped me gain much more knowledge on Android Development. Besides the features being taught in class, I have learned and implemented a lot of new features while building it. These include implementing dialog, reading the call log, and using the Broadcast Receiver to detect the state of the phone. Luckily, there are a lot of free resources available online, and the documentation provided by Google on Android is very clear, which helps me solve a lot of my problems quickly.

However, there are still some improvements that can be made if I have more time. One of them is the notification sent to the user when the app detects an incoming call. The notification features work when the application is open, however, it did not work when I put the feature in the DetectPhoneCall class. Another problem I have faced is that the phone number is blocked only in the application, not the phone, as there are security problems if the application is not the default application for phone calling. Therefore, if I have time, I would like to build a more complete app that could fulfil this feature.
